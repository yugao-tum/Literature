The study "Increasing crop rotational diversity can enhance cereal yields" by Monique E. Smith et al. explores the impact of crop rotational diversity (CRD) on cereal yields, considering factors like external nitrogen fertilization levels and functional crop groups​​.

Key findings include:

Impact of CRD on Yields: Using data from 32 long-term experiments across Europe and North America, the study reveals that increasing CRD, both in terms of species diversity and functional richness, enhances grain yields of small grain cereals and maize. This yield benefit grows over time, although winter-sown small grain cereals exhibit a yield decline at the highest species diversity levels. Diversification is particularly beneficial for cereals with low external nitrogen input, such as maize, reducing reliance on nitrogen fertilizers and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen pollution​​.

Diverse Rotations and Reduced Inputs: Diverse crop rotations require less fertilization and crop protection inputs, easing agricultural pressure on climate, soil, and biodiversity. The study indicates that CRD results in higher yields when nitrogen input is low, particularly when legumes are included. However, the extent to which diverse rotations can maintain yields and offset reduced fertilizer inputs over time for different grain crops remains unclear​​.

Crop Reactions to Functional Groups: The inclusion of certain functional groups, such as annual broadleaf and legume crops, benefits the production of winter small grain cereals. For maize, including annual legume and ley crops is beneficial, but not annual broadleaf crops. These findings suggest that ecological complementarity mechanisms play a significant role in increasing yields​​.

CRD and Crop Protection: Increasing CRD likely leads to an underestimation of its positive effects on crop protection, as chemical weed control needs often reduce with higher CRD. The diversity in root depth, architecture, and resource needs among crops leads to complementary nutrient and water uptake, enhancing soil organic carbon content and improving soil structure, nutrient stocks, water retention, and yields​​.

CRD and External Nitrogen Input: Maize yields increase more significantly with CRD under low rather than high external nitrogen conditions. The study suggests that the biophysical source of production benefits varies among crops, depending on both crop diversity and functional group richness at different nitrogen input levels​​.

General Trends and Variability: The study acknowledges large variations in growing conditions and management across experiments, indicating a general trend of high grain yield benefits from CRD. It suggests that CRD effects should be evaluated case-by-case, and individual farmers must assess its applicability​​.

Implications and Future Directions: The study highlights the need for a more diversified agricultural approach to support crop yields while reducing environmental and societal costs. This approach could also reduce food system vulnerability to climate change and stressful weather​​.

Overall, the study presents a comprehensive analysis of how increasing crop rotational diversity can enhance cereal yields, emphasizing the importance of incorporating diverse crop species and functional groups into agricultural practices for sustainable and efficient crop production.
