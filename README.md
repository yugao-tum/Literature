# Literature
 the paper "Positive but variable effects of crop diversification on biodiversity and ecosystem services" authored by Damien Beillouin and colleagues 2021, scrutinizes the effects of crop diversification on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The synthesis included 95 meta-analyses, integrating 5,156 experiments over 84 years, covering more than 54,500 observations across 120 crop species in 85 countries. The study's aim was to robustly assess the effects of various crop diversification practices at the field scale on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The motivation for this research stems from the historical context of 20th-century agricultural practices, which strongly intensified agroecosystems, leading to a decrease in cultivated plant species and contributing to several planetary boundaries' crossing. Crop diversification is proposed as a sustainable alternative, emphasizing the importance of agrobiodiversity. The paper categorizes crop diversification into five strategies: crop rotations, cover crops, agroforestry, intercropping, and variety mixtures.

The data collection involved a systematic search across multiple databases, focusing on meta-analyses that quantify the effects of crop diversification compared to less diversified references. The effect sizes from these studies were standardized and analyzed using weighted second-order meta-analysis, accounting for quality and redundancy.

The analysis revealed that crop diversification generally enhances crop production, biodiversity, and various ecosystem services like water quality, pest and disease control, and soil quality. However, the extent of these benefits varies significantly among different diversification strategies. Agroforestry emerged as particularly effective, providing substantial benefits across multiple ecosystem services. In contrast, variety mixtures showed the least benefits.

The study also highlighted the role of crop diversification in climate change mitigation. Strategies like agroforestry, intercropping, and cover crops significantly increase soil carbon content, but their impact on greenhouse gas emissions varied. Cover crops, for instance, may increase direct N2O emissions despite other benefits.

Despite positive outcomes, the paper notes substantial heterogeneity in results, influenced by the type of diversification strategy and bioclimatic conditions. It emphasizes the necessity of detailed analysis of these strategies to understand their specific impacts and guide policy and farming practices.

Finally, the paper identifies knowledge gaps, particularly in economic outcomes and yield stability, which could explain the low adoption rates of diversified strategies. It underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach and broader studies to understand the trade-offs and synergies between production and ecosystem services.

In conclusion, while crop diversification shows promise for more sustainable land management, its effectiveness varies with the strategy used and the context. The findings provide a solid foundation for future research and policy-making, contributing to the global discourse on sustainable agriculture and environmental protectio​​】.


The paper "Agricultural diversification promotes multiple ecosystem services without compromising yield," by Giovanni Tamburini et al., published in 2020, presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of agricultural diversification on ecosystem services and biodiversity, while also considering the effect on crop yields.

This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights for the development of sustainable agricultural strategies worldwide.

The academic paper titled "Long-term evidence shows that crop-rotation diversification increases agricultural resilience to adverse growing conditions in North America" by Timothy M. Bowles et al., published in 2020, presents a comprehensive study on the impact of crop-rotation diversification on agricultural resilience, particularly in maize-based systems in North America.

Key findings of the study include:
Increased Yield and Reduced Loss Under Stress: Diversified crop rotations showed an average increase of 28.1% in maize yields, including a 22.6% increase under favorable conditions. More importantly, yield losses were significantly reduced (14.0%–89.9%) in drought years. This indicates that crop-rotation diversification plays a crucial role in enhancing yield resilience to adverse weather conditions​​.

Improved Soil Health: Diversified crop rotations, particularly those beyond just two crops, likely result in increased yield resilience due to improved soil properties, such as enhanced soil water capture and storage and an abundance of beneficial soil microbes​​.

Stable or Increased Yields Over Time: Across all rotations, maize yields at all sites either increased over time or remained stable, except for two sites. In six of the 11 sites, yield growth was accelerated in more diverse crop rotations. For instance, at one site, yield growth increased by 12.70 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ for each additional unit of rotational complexity index (RCI)​​.

Resilience in Stressful Conditions: More diverse rotations increased yields in 7 of the 11 sites during the most stressful conditions. These results underscore the role of crop-rotational diversity in enhancing resilience and avoiding crop failure under stressful growing conditions​​.

Long-term Benefits and Policy Implications: The study emphasizes that long-term crop-rotational diversity should be a fundamental component of risk reduction strategies for climate-change adaptation. It also highlights the need for policies and strategies that encourage crop diversification and support sustainable agricultural practices. The study points out that current U.S. federal policies and market dynamics often favor monocultures or short rotations, which can lead to negative environmental consequences. To fully realize the benefits of crop-rotational diversity, policies that incentivize diversified cropping systems and support farmers in adopting such practices are needed​

Methodology:

The study involved data from 11 long-term experiments in the US and Canada, covering various rotations and environmental conditions.
A rotational complexity index (RCI) was used to quantify and compare the effects of rotation diversification.
Bayesian multilevel statistical models were employed to analyze the data, focusing on how diversification affects maize yields in different environmental conditions and over time.
Implications:

The findings have significant policy implications, suggesting that strategies to increase crop-rotational diversity can be a central component of risk-reduction strategies in agriculture.
The study emphasizes the potential of diversification in reducing risk from climate-change-related threats and improving the stability of food production.
Conclusions:

The paper concludes that crop-rotation diversification should be a fundamental component of strategies for climate-change adaptation and risk reduction in agriculture.
It highlights the need for policies and strategies that encourage crop diversity and support the integration of more complex rotations into farming systems.
In summary, this study provides robust evidence that diversifying crop rotations enhances the resilience of agricultural systems to adverse growing conditions, particularly drought, and increases maize yields over time. The findings are significant for policy development and the sustainable intensification of agriculture in the face of climate change and environmental challenges.


The study "Increasing crop rotational diversity can enhance cereal yields" by Smith et al., published in 2023, investigates the impact of crop rotational diversity (CRD) on cereal yields. The study used data from 32 long-term experiments across Europe and North America, focusing on small grain cereals and maize. The research found that CRD, measured as crop species diversity and functional richness, enhanced grain yields, with this benefit increasing over time. It was noted that diversification was particularly beneficial for cereals with low external nitrogen input, notably maize, enabling reduced dependence on nitrogen fertilizers and thus decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen pollution​​.

The study found that grain yields increased with higher species diversity for all indicator crops, but the effect was dependent on the external nitrogen input rate. For instance, after 35 years of diversification, there was a significant yield gain for spring small grain cereals, winter small grain cereals, and maize. The benefit of CRD increased over time, and after five years, there was a notable short-term grain yield benefit from CRD across different cereals​​.

The researchers also explored the role of functional group richness in crop rotations. They found that the greatest production benefits occurred in rotations with two to three functional groups. The benefits stemmed from the inclusion of specific crop functional groups, such as annual leguminous crops that fix atmospheric nitrogen. The inclusion of different functional groups in the rotation resulted in varied benefits for different crops, indicating that ecological complementarity mechanisms over time and space are likely important factors in CRD benefits​​.

The interaction of fertilization rate and CRD was further explored, comparing yield benefits from diversified rotations with low external nitrogen fertilization against those from adding high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer to monocultures. The study found that while high nitrogen input monoculture yields remained stable over time, low nitrogen input diversified rotations eventually produced comparable yield benefits. This suggests that increasing CRD could be more effective at low external nitrogen fertilization rates, pointing to potential rotational benefits from enhanced nitrogen use efficiency​​.

Intermediate CRD based on species diversity led to the highest yields in small grain cereals, presenting a hump-shaped relationship between grain yield and diversity. This pattern contrasts with long-term grassland experiments, where biomass yields increased monotonically with diversity. The study underscores the importance of considering the specific crop species and functional groups included in rotations, as well as the broader implications for sustainability beyond cereal yield, such as reducing the environmental and societal costs associated with heavy use of pesticides and mineral nutrients in short rotation cropping systems​
The study emphasizes that while crop diversity is crucial, it should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account local growing conditions, market value, additional land requirements, and other logistical factors. It also suggests that increasing CRD not only benefits grain yields but also supports overall agricultural sustainability by reducing dependency on external inputs like fertilizers and pesticides.

Moreover, the study highlights the potential of CRD in contributing to a more resilient and sustainable food system. More diverse crop rotations can reduce food system vulnerability to various stresses, including extreme weather, pest outbreaks, and global pandemics. This diversification also contributes to more evenly distributed production of essential nutrients, which is vital in the face of changing climate conditions and societal needs.

In conclusion, the research by Smith et al. provides compelling evidence that increasing crop rotational diversity is a promising agricultural practice. It can enhance cereal yields, improve soil fertility and nutrient efficiency, and decrease the need for external inputs, thereby supporting more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. However, the implementation of CRD must consider local agricultural practices, crop choices, and broader socio-economic factors to fully realize its benefits.

The article titled "AI- and data-driven pre-crop values and crop rotation matrices" Fenz.etc 2023 delves into the topic of crop rotation planning, which is crucial for both organic and conventional agriculture. It aims to optimize soil productivity, crop yield, and resistance to pests and weeds through effective rotation strategies. The paper highlights the importance of understanding which crops to grow in succession to achieve synergistic effects.

Key Points from the Article:
Research Focus: The study investigates whether yield-enhancing crop combination data, derived from measured, clustered, and standardized NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values, align with existing literature and expert knowledge from long-term field experiments.

Pre-Crop Value Concept: The paper discusses the concept of pre-crop value, which refers to the impact of a crop on the subsequent crop through soil mediation. This includes both direct effects from the immediately preceding crop and indirect effects from cumulative preceding crops.

Development of AI4CROPR Method: The authors introduce AI4CROPR, a method for determining crop rotation matrices using satellite data combined with open data baseline knowledge. This method analyzed 24,352 unique crop rotations on organically farmed plots in Lower Austria from 2017 to 2021, using NDVI values from Sentinel-2 data to estimate yield potential.

Innovative Approaches:
The AI4CROPR method clusters agricultural plots based on soil, weather, and management conditions, distinguishing between spring and winter crops for accurate NDVI value measurement.
It predicts NDVI for various predecessor/successor crop combinations, creating a data-based crop rotation matrix.
Implications for Crop Rotation Planning:
This research provides a data-driven approach to understanding the effects of different crop rotations, which could significantly enhance crop planning and management strategies in agriculture. The use of AI and satellite data presents a modern solution to an age-old agricultural challenge, potentially leading to more sustainable and efficient farming practices.

The article "End-to-end learned early classification of time series for in-season crop type mapping" by Rußwurm et al. (2023) presents the ELECTS model, a novel approach for early and accurate classification of time series data. This model is particularly relevant for applications in satellite-based crop type mapping. The key aspects of this work include:

Objective and Methodology: The study focuses on developing an end-to-end learned model for early classification of time series data. The ELECTS (End-to-End Learned Early Classification of Time Series) model is proposed for this purpose. The model is designed to simultaneously optimize for earliness and accuracy in classification tasks. It employs deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to process satellite time series data and produce predictions.

Datasets and Implementation: The ELECTS model is evaluated on four crop classification datasets from Europe (BreizhCrops in France, BavarianCrops in Germany) and Africa (Ghana and South Sudan). These datasets vary in size, with the European datasets being larger. The implementation of ELECTS involves a two-head decision model with an RNN feature extractor and a specialized loss function.

Findings and Results: The results demonstrate that ELECTS can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in crop type classification while reducing the amount of data needed for processing. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for large-scale monitoring tasks using satellite imagery. The experiments show ELECTS's effectiveness across different geographical regions and datasets.

Applications and Implications: The study highlights the potential applications of the ELECTS model in agricultural monitoring, particularly for in-season crop type mapping. This approach can support more efficient and timely decision-making in agricultural management and policy.

Open Access and Code Availability: The research is conducted with a commitment to open science principles. The source code for the ELECTS model is made available publicly, allowing for broader use and adaptation of the method.

Conclusion: The ELECTS model represents a significant advancement in the field of remote sensing and time series analysis. It offers a robust solution for early and accurate classification of crop types, leveraging the growing availability of satellite time series data.

This study is a valuable contribution to the field of remote sensing and agricultural monitoring, providing a novel tool for analyzing satellite time series data for crop type classification.

The paper "Crop Rotation Modeling for Deep Learning-Based Parcel Classification from Satellite Time Series" by Quinton and Landrieu 2021 focuses on the crucial yet often overlooked role of annual crop rotations in agricultural optimization and crop type mapping. The main purpose of this paper is to model the inter- and intra-annual agricultural dynamics of yearly parcel classification using a deep learning approach, leveraging the increasing quantity of annotated satellite data. This approach led to an improvement of over 6.3% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) over the state-of-the-art crop classification and a reduction of over 21% in error rate. Additionally, the paper introduces the first large-scale multi-year agricultural dataset with over 300,000 annotated parcels​​.

The authors employed several innovative methods for their research and analysis:

Dataset: The study used a dataset based on parcels within the 31TFM Sentinel-2 tile, covering an area of 110 × 110 km² in the South East of France. The dataset included over 54,000 ha of corn and 30,000 ha of wheat, with meadows being the most common crop type. The data spanned three years (2018-2020) and involved Sentinel-2 level 2A images. Stable parcels with minor contour changes over the years were selected for the study​​.

Pixel-Set and Temporal Attention Encoders: The Pixel Set Encoder (PSE) and Temporal Attention Encoder (TAE) were used. The PSE is a spatio-spectral encoder that generates descriptors of the spectral distribution of observations within a parcel, and the TAE is a temporal sequence encoder based on language processing literature, adapted for processing Satellite Image Time Series (SITS)​​.

Multi-Year Modeling: The study introduced a modification to the PSE+LTAE network to model crop rotation. This involved augmenting the spatio-temporal descriptors by concatenating the sum of one-hot-encoded labels for the previous two years, allowing the model to simultaneously learn inter-annual crop rotations and intra-annual evolution of parcels’ spectral statistics​​.

Training Protocol: A mixed-year training protocol was used, training a single model with parcels from all available years. This approach aimed to create richer and more resilient descriptors by exposing the model to data from different years, each with varying meteorological conditions​​.

Cross-Validation: The data was divided into 5 folds for cross-validation, with each fold being trained on 3 folds and using the last fold for calibration and model selection. This approach ensured that parcels did not appear in multiple folds for different years, avoiding data contamination and self-correlation​​.

The key findings and statistics in the paper are:

Performance Improvement: The mixed-year model (Mmixed) significantly outperformed the specialized models, demonstrating better generalizability and precision. This model obtained an mIoU of 84.7% and an overall accuracy of 98.1% on the training set​​​​.

Influence of Crop Rotation Modeling: The proposed model (Mdec) achieved higher performance than the single-year model (Msingle) with a 6.3% mIoU gap. This improvement was attributed to the model's ability to consider both the current year’s observations and the influence of past cultivated crops​​.

Overall Impact: Training a deep learning model from multi-year observations improved its ability to generalize and resulted in better precision across different crop types, especially for those with strong temporal structures​​.

In summary, this paper made significant strides in improving automated crop type mapping by incorporating multi-year data and crop rotation dynamics into a deep learning framework, demonstrating notable improvements in classification accuracy and precision.

The study "Mapping of crop types and crop sequences with combined time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 data for Germany" by Blickensdörfer et al. in 2022 focuses on creating high-resolution national-scale maps of agricultural land to address global challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss​​. It emphasizes the importance of agriculture in sustaining future livelihoods and the need for detailed maps of agricultural land cover for developing strategies for sustainable agriculture​​.

Remote sensing is identified as an effective tool for generating information on agricultural land cover over large areas, utilizing satellite data from European and US missions. The study combines images from Sentinel-2A, 2B, and Landsat-8, which improves the density of cloud-free observations, and augments optical time series with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in areas with frequent cloud cover​​.

The study outlines the challenges in remote sensing-based crop type mapping, emphasizing the high local variation and temporal dynamics of agricultural landscapes. Factors like farming practices, the genotype of crops, topography, soil, and environmental conditions all affect crop phenology and lead to high in-class variance of the spectral-temporal signal​​.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the potential of combining dense Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 (S2/L8) and monthly Sentinel-1 (S1) time series with environmental data for improving national-scale crop type mapping and to analyze multi-year annual national-scale crop type maps for crop sequence analysis​​.

Germany was selected as the study area for its diverse agricultural landscape. The study covered the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, which exhibited contrasting seasonal weather conditions, providing a test ground for assessing the repeatability of crop type mapping under varying meteorological conditions​​.

In terms of methodology, the study used the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE) for processing remote sensing data. Optical satellite data were corrected for atmospheric and geometric effects, and Sentinel-1 data were acquired as monthly VH and VV backscatter composites​​. Environmental predictor variables related to topography, temperature, and precipitation were also included to account for the agro-ecological gradients across Germany​​.

The reference dataset was retrieved from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), and samples from the reference parcels were randomly selected for training and validation of the crop type model​​. The random forest classifier was used for crop type classification, considering various feature sets, and model performance was assessed based on overall accuracy and class-wise user’s and producer’s accuracy​​.

Finally, the crop type maps with the highest accuracies were used to analyze tri-annual crop sequence patterns across Germany. The study grouped the crop legends of the annual maps into four categories based on physiological differences and sowing dates​​. Overall classification accuracy for different input feature sets was compared, with the highest overall accuracy achieved when combining all available data sources. The study found that combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6% to 10% compared to single sensor approaches​​.

The classification accuracy of the 23 crop type classes (and Small Woody Features) based on the best performing model with the full feature set was described, with accuracies for the dominant crop types ranging between 68% and 96%​

The study "Mapping Crop Types of Germany by Combining Temporal Statistical Metrics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2" by Asam et al. in 2022 aimed to create a comprehensive map of German agricultural land, recognizing the importance of such data for sustainable land management, food security, biodiversity, and soil fertility. The study utilized data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, combining multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series to classify 17 different crop classes at 10 m spatial resolution for Germany in 2018. The approach involved using monthly statistics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series, reducing the amount of input data and preprocessing steps while retaining crucial phenological information for crop type discrimination​​.

The study area was Germany, which had approximately 52% of its total area under agricultural use in 2018, with maize, winter wheat, rapeseed, and winter barley being the main crops​​. For reference data, the study used the Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) data of 2018 for crop mask generation, and the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data from 2018 covering 15 of the 16 German Federal States for training and validation data​​. The methodology for crop type sampling involved randomly selecting data for training and validation from LPIS classes, with specific measures to ensure representativeness and reduce noise​​.

The classification approach employed a supervised pixel-based Random Forest (RF) classifier, extensively tested for different land cover and crop type classifications. This model was built using training data from LPIS and remote sensing features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. To assess the effect of multispectral and SAR data on classification accuracies, three experiments were conducted using all available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 features (336 features named "S12"), only Sentinel-1 features (72 features named "S1"), and only Sentinel-2 features (264 features named "S2")​​.

The accuracy assessment involved using independent data for validation and calculating overall accuracy, precision (user's accuracy), recall (producer's accuracy), and the F1-score. The study differentiated between model accuracy and map accuracy, with the former quantifying the separability of classes in each RF model and the latter estimating the probability of any given pixel in a map to be correctly classified​​.

The results showed that the highest overall map accuracy (75.5%) was achieved with the combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (S12), while using only Sentinel-2 features resulted in a map overall accuracy (OA) of 69.7%, and only Sentinel-1 features achieved the lowest map OA of 66.6%. The study also analyzed feature importance, finding that Sentinel-2 features were more important in the combined sensor approach, with NDVI identified as the most critical variable for crop type discrimination​​.

The study "Multi-Data Approach for remote sensing-based regional crop rotation mapping: A case study for the Rur catchment Germany" by Waldhoff et al. in 2017 focuses on mapping actual crop rotations in the Rur catchment in western Germany. The study is significant for assessing crop-specific management in a spatio-temporal context, essential for regional agro-ecosystem modeling. The methodology employed combines multitemporal multispectral remote sensing data, ancillary information, and expert knowledge on crop phenology in a GIS-based Multi-Data Approach (MDA). The key aspects of the methodology include using physical block data to differentiate arable land from other land use types, classifying remote sensing scenes from specific time periods favorable for differentiating certain crop types, and sequentially analyzing multitemporal classification results​​.

The introduction highlights the importance of spatial land use data, including information on crop types and rotations, for optimized crop management, forecasting yield, and modeling matter fluxes in agro-ecosystems. However, spatio-temporal data on crop types and rotations at the field level for regional scales are rare​​.

The study area, the Rur catchment, mainly located in western Germany, covers about 3400 km². The northern part is characterized by flat terrain with intensive agriculture, while the southern part has low mountain ranges dominated by forest areas and grassland​​.

The MDA used in the study integrates ancillary information during various phases of analysis. Ancillary datasets were crucial for obtaining detailed spatial crop type information from the available imagery. The Authoritative Topographic-Cartographic Information System (ATKIS) was used for this purpose, providing topographical and land use information for Germany​​.

The methodology for annual crop type mapping involves a remote sensing part and a GIS part, with crop type-specific phenology being a key consideration. Every image was classified individually using supervised pixel-based classification methods like Maximum Likelihood (MLC) or alternatives​​.

Finally, the study presents results for the integration of annual crop maps into a single crop sequence dataset. This dataset provides insights into the practiced crop rotations, which are found to be extremely heterogeneous and contain a large number of crop sequences diverging from modeled rotations. This integration of remote sensing-based data into crop rotation mapping can significantly reduce uncertainties in regional agro-ecosystem modeling​

The main purpose of the paper "Crop mapping from image time series: Deep learning with multi-scale label hierarchies" by Turkoglu et al. 2021 is to map agricultural crops by classifying satellite image time series using a deep learning network architecture that exploits a hierarchical tree structure of crop type labels. This approach significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types by allowing the model to predict three labels at different levels of granularity for each pixel, enhancing classification performance at the fine-grained level​​​​.

The methods used in the research include:

Hierarchical Deep Learning Network Architecture: The architecture combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks to exploit a tree-structured label hierarchy, encode image data, and represent time series. The network predicts successively finer label resolutions in the hierarchical tree, and a label refinement module refines these predictions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that exploits correlations between labels across the hierarchy​​.

ZueriCrop Dataset: The research introduces the ZueriCrop dataset, which is based on farm census data from the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture. It includes 116,000 field instances from the Swiss Cantons of Zurich and Thurgau, covering 48 different classes with a highly imbalanced class distribution. The dataset contains multi-spectral Sentinel-2 Level-2A bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance images collected over a 50 km × 48 km area​​.

Evaluation Methodology: The study employs 5-fold leave-one-out cross-validation, dividing the dataset into five geographically disjoint strips and using four as the training set and one as the test set. Classification performance is evaluated using metrics like overall accuracy, average per-class precision, recall, and F1-score​​.

Key data and statistics mentioned in the paper include:

Dataset Overview: ZueriCrop spans 48 crop classes and 28,000 multi-temporal image patches from Sentinel-2. The dataset's area covers 50 km × 48 km in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Thurgau with 116,000 individual fields​​.

Performance Metrics: The hierarchical ms-convSTAR significantly outperforms other models, increasing mean class precision by more than 11 percentage points and mean class recall by more than 10 percentage points. The F1-score increases by more than 11 percentage points compared to the baseline. This improvement is especially notable in the classification of less frequent classes​​.

Comparison with Baselines: The hierarchical ms-convSTAR outperforms all baseline models on all performance metrics. Data augmentation, a baseline method, improves the F1-score by 2.9 percentage points compared to the baseline convSTAR but decreases overall accuracy significantly by 2.3 percentage points​​.

In summary, this paper presents a novel approach to crop mapping from satellite image time series, leveraging hierarchical label structures and deep learning techniques to improve classification accuracy, especially for rare crop types. The use of the ZueriCrop dataset provides a realistic scenario for testing and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method over traditional approaches.

The study "Pixel-based yield mapping and prediction from Sentinel-2 using spectral indices and neural networks" by Perich et al. 2023 aims to map and predict crop yield on a large scale, particularly in smaller scaled agricultural settings like Switzerland. The study focuses on using high-resolution Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for within-field crop yield modeling at the pixel level, employing a mix of spectral indices, raw satellite reflectance data, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) approach​​.

Key components of the study include:

Yield Data: The study used yield data from a large farm in western Switzerland, focusing on cereal crops like winter wheat, winter barley, and triticale from 2017 to 2021. The data was pre-processed and rasterised to a 10m raster for modeling, resulting in 54,098 pixels with yield information for the cereal crops (CR) dataset and 20,170 pixels for the winter wheat (WW) subset​​.

Sentinel-2 Data: All available S2 scenes from January 2017 to December 2021 were downloaded and pre-processed. The analysis excluded bands affected by atmospheric disturbances and used the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) to filter out clouds, cloud shadows, dark areas, and defective pixels. This resulted in a comprehensive dataset for modeling, with data from 134 S2 scenes retained for analysis​​.

Methods: Four different models were compared for their applicability in crop yield modeling and prediction: two based on spectral indices (partial integral at peak GCVI and smoothed NDVI), one using all available spectral bands of S2 (four S2 scenes method), and an RNN model. The study aimed to assess the robustness, accuracy, and data processing needs of these methods​​.

Results: The models performed best when using data from all years, with R2 values up to 0.88 and relative RMSE up to 10.49%. However, performance was poor when predicting on unseen data years, particularly for years with unknown weather patterns. The RNN showed similar performance across different input S2 time series, with the cloudy time series exhibiting the best performance in some cases. The four S2 scenes method and the RNN had the lowest RMSE values, indicating their effectiveness​​​​​​.

Cross-Year Performance: The models struggled to predict crop yield accurately for unseen data years. Negative R2 values were recorded for the WW subset and most of the CR dataset, indicating that predictions were far from the mean of the test data. Only the four S2 scenes and RNN methods showed positive but low R2 values for the holdout years 2017–2019​​.

Discussion: The study demonstrates that precise yield modeling and prediction are feasible using high-resolution S2 imagery in smaller scaled agricultural settings. It highlights the potential for such satellite-based approaches to assist farmers in making informed management decisions and for policymakers to assess yield gaps and food security. The study also discusses the need for calibration of yield data and suggests that validation studies in different regions are necessary for broader application​​.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive approach to crop yield modeling using Sentinel-2 data, demonstrating the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery in precision agriculture, especially in smaller agricultural settings. The combination of different modeling methods, including RNNs and spectral indices, provides insights into the possibilities and limitations of current satellite-based yield prediction technologies.

The study "Mapping Crop Rotation by Using Deeply Synergistic Optical and SAR Time Series" by Liu et al. 2021 aimed to improve the mapping of crop rotation patterns, a crucial aspect of agricultural management impacting food security and agro-ecosystem sustainability. The main focus was on developing a hybrid deep learning architecture, the Crop Rotation Mapping (CRM) model, which synergizes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical time series data for mapping crop rotations. This approach showed significant improvement over traditional methods, particularly for complex rotation types like fallow-single rice and crayfish-single rice, with an accuracy greater than 0.85 and a gain of four points in overall accuracy compared to ablation models​​​​.

Key aspects of the study include:

Ground-Truth Data Collection: Field surveys were conducted to gather ground truth data on crop rotation for three years (2018–2020). A total of 689 ground samples were collected, with additional non-cropland samples added through visual interpretation on Google Earth. This data helped classify six main rotation types and four non-rotation classes for model training​​.

CRM Architecture: The CRM model consists of two streams, each designed for SAR and optical time series data. These streams use a one-dimensional CNN (Conv1D) and an LSTM with an attention mechanism (AttLSTM). The CNN extracts hierarchical rotation features, while the LSTM depicts temporal crop growing patterns. The concatenated feature vectors from both streams are then processed through fully connected layers to produce the final rotation decision​​.

Experiment Design and Comparative Analysis: The study compared the performance of the CRM model against four competing models (RF(S2), LSTM(S2), CRM(S2), and CRM(NoAtt)) using different vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, kNDVI) as inputs. This comparison aimed to evaluate the CRM's effectiveness against classical and advanced models and to analyze the sensitivity of various vegetation indices as model inputs​​.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy indices and a confusion matrix, including global and per-class accuracy, kappa coefficient, and F1 score. These metrics helped determine the model's ability to accurately predict crop rotation types​​.

Results and Sensitivity Analysis: The CRM model, using kNDVI as the vegetation index, achieved the highest accuracy (0.876) among all tested models and vegetation indices. CRM outperformed the mono-source competing methods (RF(S2), LSTM(S2), and CRM(S2)) with an average accuracy of 0.87. The CRM also showed superior capabilities when combining multiple satellite sources and utilizing the attention mechanism, which assigned greater weights to more important timestamps​​.

In conclusion, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the CRM model in mapping crop rotations using a combination of SAR and optical time series data. The model's ability to leverage complementary signals from different sensors and the use of deep learning frameworks enabled it to capture complex intra-annual rotation information suitable for diverse crop types and flexible farming practices. The research highlights the potential of advanced deep learning techniques in enhancing the precision and utility of agricultural mapping systems, especially in the context of dynamic crop rotation mapping​​.

The study "Crop switching can enhance environmental sustainability and farmer incomes in China" by Xie et al., published in 2023, addresses the challenge of achieving food-system sustainability in China. Since 1990, China has doubled its crop production, but this has led to significant environmental compromises, including increased greenhouse gas emissions, intensified fertilizer and pesticide use, and declining groundwater levels. The Chinese government is considering various interventions to enhance production efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, including crop switching, which is the focus of this study​​.

The study involves a comprehensive analysis of crop switching across China, focusing on 13 crops that account for 94% of China's primary crop production and 90% of its harvested area. The researchers combined data on crop-specific yields, harvested areas, environmental footprints, and farmer incomes to construct a linear optimization model. This model assesses the potential contributions of crop switching to sustainable agricultural development, taking into account various sustainability dimensions such as water demand, GHG emissions, fertilizer and pesticide use, and economic output​​.

The study reveals that crop switching can significantly enhance sustainable development, with the potential to substantially reduce demands for blue and green water, GHG emissions, and the use of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potash fertilizers, as well as pesticides. Importantly, these benefits can be achieved without expanding cropland, reducing the production of any crop, or decreasing farmer incomes​​.

The research also identifies that effective crop switching requires coordinated action across different government departments to avoid trade-offs between various sustainability goals. The study presents different optimization scenarios, including siloed approaches where each ministry focuses on a single sustainability outcome and more integrated approaches that consider multiple sustainability dimensions simultaneously​​.

Additionally, the study demonstrates that crop switching can significantly contribute to meeting China’s 2030 agricultural sustainable development targets. The findings suggest that crop switching could save substantial amounts of water, reduce GHG emissions, and contribute to fertilizer and pesticide savings. Moreover, this approach could also lead to significant global resource savings, especially in the context of agricultural trade, by reducing China's dependence on imported crops like soybeans and thereby impacting the global trade network​​.

Finally, the study provides a scientific basis for sustainable agricultural interventions in China. It emphasizes the importance of coordinated efforts and spatially detailed solutions based on local conditions and sustainability priorities. Such targeted interventions can lead to substantial benefits in specific regions of China, offering opportunities for policymakers to implement effective crop switching strategies​​.
